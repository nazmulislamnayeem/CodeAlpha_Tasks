# 🛰️ Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer – CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship

This project is a **Python-based real-time network sniffer** built using the `scapy` library. It captures and analyzes live packets from the network, extracting:

- Source and destination IP addresses
- Protocol type and number (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP)
- Raw payloads (decoded safely or shown in hex)

✅ Completed as part of the CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship.
